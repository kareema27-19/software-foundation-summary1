1. Front-End (Client-Side)

Responsibility:
The front-end is what the user interacts with directly. It’s responsible for displaying information, collecting input, and providing a smooth user experience.

Key Tasks:

Designing the layout, look, and feel of the application (UI/UX).

Handling user interactions (clicks, forms, navigation).

Sending requests to the back-end and displaying responses.

Ensuring responsiveness across devices (desktop, mobile).

Technologies Used:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Frameworks like React, Angular, Vue

Example:
When you log into a website:

Front-end shows the login form.

Takes your username and password.

Sends it to the back-end for verification.

Shows success or error message.

2. Back-End (Server-Side)

Responsibility:
The back-end is the “brain” behind the application. It processes requests, performs business logic, and communicates with the database.

Key Tasks:

Handling user requests coming from the front-end.

Validating data and enforcing rules (business logic).

Managing authentication, authorization, and security.

Integrating with databases, third-party APIs, and services.

Technologies Used:

Languages: Java, Python, C#, Node.js, PHP

Frameworks: Express.js, Django, Spring, .NET

Example:
When you submit your login info:

Back-end checks if the username/password is correct.

Generates a session token if valid.

Sends the result back to the front-end.

3. Database

Responsibility:
The database stores, retrieves, and manages data. It ensures data is consistent, secure, and quickly accessible.

Key Tasks:

Storing structured (SQL) or unstructured (NoSQL) data.

Managing relationships between data entities.

Ensuring data integrity and consistency.

Handling queries from the back-end efficiently.

Technologies Used:

Relational DBs: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle

NoSQL DBs: MongoDB, Cassandra, Firebase

Example:
For login:

Database stores your username and encrypted password.

Back-end queries the database to verify credentials.

Database responds with success/failure.

How They Work Together

Front-end: User submits login → sends data to back-end.

Back-end: Receives data → applies rules → queries database.

Database: Returns data → back-end processes it → sends result to front-end.

Front-end: Displays message to user.

Think of it as a restaurant:

Front-end = Waiter (takes your order, delivers food).

Back-end = Kitchen (prepares food according to order).

Database = Pantry (stores ingredients, retrieves them when needed).
