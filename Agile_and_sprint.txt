1. Agile

Agile is a software development methodology (or mindset) focused on flexibility, collaboration, and delivering value quickly. Instead of planning an entire project upfront, Agile emphasizes:

Iterative development: Work is done in small increments, allowing frequent reassessment.

Customer collaboration: Continuous feedback ensures the product meets actual needs.

Responding to change: Plans can adapt as requirements evolve.

Self-organizing teams: Teams decide how to best accomplish work.

Key Agile frameworks include:

Scrum

Kanban

Extreme Programming (XP)

2. Sprint

A Sprint is a time-boxed iteration in Agile (specifically in Scrum):

Typically lasts 1–4 weeks.

During a sprint, a team commits to completing a set of tasks or user stories.

It ends with:

A potentially shippable product increment.

A Sprint Review (demonstration of work done).

A Sprint Retrospective (discussion of improvements for the next sprint).

Analogy: Think of Agile as the philosophy of “building software in small, adaptable steps,” and a Sprint as one step or cycle in that process.
